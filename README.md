## Setup Instructions

### 1. Open the Project

1. Open `KnightsSoundboard.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select your development team in the project settings
3. Update the bundle identifier if needed

### 2. Configure Apple Music Access

The app is already configured with the necessary permissions in `Info.plist`:
- `NSAppleMusicUsageDescription`: "This app needs access to Apple Music to play soundboard clips and music."

### 3. Add MusicKit Framework

1. In Xcode, select your project in the navigator
2. Go to the target's "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section
3. Click the "+" button and add "MusicKit.framework"

### 4. Customize Soundboard Buttons

Edit the `soundboardButtons` array in `SoundboardView.swift` to add your own themed buttons:

```swift
private let soundboardButtons: [SoundboardButton] = [
    SoundboardButton(title: "Victory", emoji: "üèÜ", searchQuery: "victory music"),
    SoundboardButton(title: "Epic", emoji: "‚öîÔ∏è", searchQuery: "epic battle music"),
    // Add your own buttons here
]
```

### 5. Add Local Sound Files (Optional)

To add local sound files for instant playback:

1. Add your `.mp3` or `.wav` files to the Xcode project
2. Update the soundboard buttons to use local files:

```swift
SoundboardButton(title: "Custom Sound", emoji: "üéµ", localSoundFile: "your_sound_file")
```
